Write the logic to get the computer choice
Create a new function named getComputerChoice
and it will randomly return one of the following string values rock, paper or scissors

so first need to assign paper, scissors, rock to a number so Math.Rand can pick those values.
That way it could only be around those values not bigger or smaller.
We know thats math.random returns greater than 0 but less than 1

Write the logic to get human choice
Create a new function named getHumanChoice
Return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs

So we will be using the prompt for this one
And we do not need to handle any errors
Still make it that rocks = Rocks 
Maybe use a lowercase or uppercase letter from before
